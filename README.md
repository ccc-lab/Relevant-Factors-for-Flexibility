# Relevant Factors for Flexibility

How does constituent order vary cross-linguistically, and what drives this variation? Large-scale typological
databases such as WALS (Dryer & Haspelmath 2013) and AUTOTYP (Bickel et al. 2017) have focused on cat-
aloging the dominant constituent orders of the world’s languages. However, languages vary not only in their
primary order(s), but also in the number of additional orders speakers accept and the degree to which they accept
them—their flexibility (Namboodiripad 2017). Here, we compare the criteria used by each database in determining
(non)dominant constituent order and argue that expanding existing notions of flexibility can lead to important
insights about this variation and its s
